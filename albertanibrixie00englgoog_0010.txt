we ceu draw any information on the life of Albertano are,
besides 4 few historicel documents in which he is meu-
tioued‚ the scanty notices contained in the introductione
and explicite olbis writiugs¹. There he alwsys cells him·
sols causidicus Bririensie deoru Sancto Aqathm or carisi·
dicus de Sancta Anatho, which, however, does notimply,
that he was born et Brescie, or especially in the quarter
ofS.Agathe, bnt only that he was a judge at Brescia, aud
lived there ². At all events he was a citizen of that com·
munity3 aud, as Jacopo Malvezzi eud others epeek of hie
family end himself as of Brescieus‚ we have uo reason
· to doubt thet this town was his birth-place.

The year of Albertauo's birth is not known3 yet, hy
i'uferences drawn from the data efforded by his writiugs,
it will be possible to come to auepproximative determina·v
tion. From the dedication af his Liber Consolationis et
Consilii, written iu the year 1246, we learn that his son
Gioveuui at that time not only studied the chirurgical art,
but must have begun to practise it; he cannot therefore
have been less thau about twenty years old. As Albertauo
evidently in the seme manner dedicated his book De Arte

brixiensis. Per haec tempore [1135] Alberteuus ds Albentenis iurisperitus
civis egregius ln bec Giritete hebebatur, vir precipuus, sepientis plenus.
illc multe blorellum dogmate ed utilitatem suorum Civium ceterorumque
legentium quosdam libros componens mirabiliter scripsit''.
