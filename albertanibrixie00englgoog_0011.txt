to his other sons, Stefano aud Vincenzio, at their entrance
int‘u practica} life, they must have been 01 about the same
age when they received 11010 their father those writiugs
101101 instruction aud advice, destined tu guide them 00
their way through life. Now the 11001100 Dc Amore ct
·Dilcctionc Dei, dedicated 10 1110 0111001 000, Viuoenzio,
was written in the year 12383 aud, it the eldest sou was
at that-time about twenty years old, it is likely 11101111-
bertano had ruarried in 1217. Should we suppose him to

have wedded at the age 01 twenty-four ortweuty·five years, ’

we may conclude that he was born in 1193 01 1192. At ’
011 events we may safely state that Albertauo was 'born in ⁴
the 1001 decennium 01 the twellth century.

At that period Brescia was rising 1001 10 wealth aud
power. The league formed by the Lombard 011100, 1167,
had iu the year 1176 conquered Frederick Barbarossa in
the battle 01 Legnano. A truce 01 six years followed ;
by the treaty 01 constance, 1183, the Lombard cities re-
cognized indeed the emperor 00 their liege iord, but 01 the
same time reserved 10 themselves such extensive liberty, .
that they in fact were almost eutitled to the 00010 01 inde-

· pendent republics. The emperor confirmed their right ot'

fortificatiou, 01 confederation and 01. making war and peace ; '
he recognized their right 01 electing their own consuls,
tu whom he was only to grant the investiture of the em-
pire; aud he allowedlthem independent exercise 01 juris-
diction, except in cases 01 appeal, as to which he re·
served his influence through the podesth. Bremia, al·
ready possessed ui independent jurisdiction even iu cases
01 appeal, appears moreover 10 have obtained by special
favour the privilege 01 appointing its consuls without im-
perial investiture¹. Such were the brilliant results 01 the
confederation formed by the rich Lombard communities ior
the purpose of delivering themselves from the German sway.
