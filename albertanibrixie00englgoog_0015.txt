character *and his military skill. Yet he was obliged to
surrender on the twenty-sirth oi ¹August 1238. ,
lt was in his prison n't Cremona that'Albertano com·
posed his first and most extensive treatise De Amore et ⁵
Dilectione Dei et i'roxinei et Aliarum iderunt, et de Forma
Vitoe, dedicated to his eldest son, Vincentio⁹. WhetherAlber·
tarro was released iu October, when'Frederi'ck was obliged to
give up his unsuccessful siege of Brescia, we do not know,

his treatise De Arte (or Doctrina) Loquendi ct Tacendi, ·

great number of manuscripts ; but, as it seems, bibliogra-
phers do not know the existence of an impression men·
