aud notarios. Among the judges of Emanuele Maggi was,
no doubt, Albertano, when he made before the judges aud
notaries of Genova his speech Super confirmations vitae ·

dressed to the Bresoian judges or lawyers and the Fran·
ciscan friars, when they were “as usual' assembled at
Midlent in the monastery of that order, for the purpose of
feediug the poor. They are oomposed quite in the same
manner as Albertauo's other writings, in an edifyiug aud
religious rather thau academioal strain, and might very
well be called sermons. So we have no reason whatever
to adopt the name oi Academy, bestowed upon those as·
semblies by Federico Odorici. Three of these speeohes are ,
