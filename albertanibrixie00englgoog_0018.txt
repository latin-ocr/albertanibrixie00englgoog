ascribed to Albertano by Huillard·Briholles, is mentioned
by nobody else¹. Whether Albertano is really the author
of this piace, is a question we must leave undatermined.
· Not so the assertion of Crescimbeni, repeated by Quadrio,

Ι that certain manuscripts of Albertano's worlrs should con·

tain poems fronr his hand, which has been proved to be
Ι decidedly selsel.

Resumiug the preceding notices on the life of Albertano,
we find that it presents two distinct periods‚ one of active
participatior] in public affairs, until 1238, the other of‘lite·
rary productiori, from 1238 until 1250. That his occupa-
tious during the latter years were owing to his with·
drawing from public life, we nray guess, though not assent,
from some words (below p. 65-66) in which he blames
those decisions in state affairs thet “follow the pleasure of
the multitude, and not thewisdom of the few''. Oi his
life after 1250, when he was about 58 years old, we know
nothing; nor do we know when he died. Fed. Odorici
tells ns indeed, referring to Maznuchelli, yet without saying
where, that he died about 12703 hut thiais certainlya
mere supposition.

Tiraboschi has passed a very harsh judgment on the
writings of Albertano.l, “From this anthor'', he says, “we
must not expect method in treating his subject, nor force .
of reasoning nor precision of ideas. He almost contenta
himself with joining 'together passages from the Scrip-
ture, and from many sacred and profane authors, on ,
the matter he discusses3 and at the time when he lived

mini'’‚ These sermones do not appear to have bean ever printed. The
editions mentioued by F. Odorici (p. 359, n. 2) arc, lsuppma, editions .
of the Tuast. de Arte Loquendi.
