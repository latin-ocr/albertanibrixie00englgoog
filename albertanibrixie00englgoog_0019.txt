it is no little praise that be could do thus much'·'. This
judgment hus been repeated, almost word lor word, by .
Naunucci, but rejected by Pauliu Paris, who supposes Ti-
·raboschi had not even read Albertano's Book of Consola-
tion and Counsel, which lookiug not at itsubulk, but its -
'litera-ry merit, is his priucipal work¹. Albertano is so
far from deserving any reproach l'or want of method, that
