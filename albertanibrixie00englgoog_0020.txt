chosen by the author for conveying to the public hie moral
instructions in general, and for inculcating sonnder prin-
ciples regarding fonds and private vengeance, which is
more particularly his scope in the Book of consolation.
There can be no doubt that this form has rendered it more
attractive to its readers. And yet the tale is partly al-
legorized by Albertano himself (see p. 211. p. 84), ¹and
Prudentia, if notMelibeus, must at least in part be
considered as an allegorieal personage. As Albertano's Book
of Consolation and Counsel, loohing at its title and the
dialogue, has some resemblance to the book ofBoethius on
the Consolation of Philosophy, his Prudentia is not without ·
a certain analogy to the Philosophia of Boethius¹. But
it is from a passage of Cassiodorus, quoted by Albertano
’ (p. 20), that he has taken the name of his heroine, if we
may eall her so, and the general idea of her character:
superavit cuncta infatigabilis ct capeditc madentia. The
name of Melibeus, the'outline of his person, and the
first sketch of the whole narrative, he found in this distich,

which he (p. 53) wrongly ascribes to Μ1111111119

Consilio juvenum fidis, Melibee; ruinam
Expectare potes, dum sine consilio es.

Albertano derives the name of his hero from mel and gg.- ’
. hene (p. 83), and describes him as an honest but rash and
hothrained young ¹man of high ranh,⁸ indulgiog himself in
the pleasures of life and confiding too much in his riches·

·¹ Thia resemblance has mislad some authors to believe that Albertano
1111 Boethius, wrote his Boolr os Gorrsolation during his imprisonment.
Sea, for instance, Ottavio Rossi, Elopi Histerici di Brcsciorri Illaeiri,
Brerela ¹620, 4⁰, p. 163.

¹ 1111 wrong 111 asserting, in Bruneito Latiam 11111111 ⁰9 Sirificr,
p. 181, n. 4, that Albertano knew the true Martialis. This error was owing
to the fact, that 1 had found in the treatise De Amore et Dilectione Dei
an epigram admitted ln old editions of Martialis, but recognized by modern
critice to be falae.
