His wife, Prudentia, on the other hand, is painted as a ·
strong and 'noble-minded but kindhearted and religious
woman, far superior to her husband in knowledge and in-
telligente, though not unacquainted with those small and
harmless, or at least vell-meant artifices aud stratagems
that are so characteristic of her sex. Unhappily, Alber-
tanc has identified her with himself to such a degree, that ·
she not only quotes all sorts of authors. even Albertano
himself, but reasons' in juridical matters like an accom-
plished lawyer, equally versed in tbe Digest and the Decre-
tals Indeed if we did not remember her allegorical dig-
, nity, we might be tempted to use a modern term and call
her a most terrible blus-stocbing. Yet vitb this restric-
tion Albertano shows himself ib the narrative part ofhis
book upon the yvhole a tolerably skilful painter, not only
of characters but also of scenes, ,as may be seen in his

⁴ ¹description of the tumultuary couucil (p. 6-11).

The dialogue parts of the book, like the other vvritings
of Albertano, are interveven with very copious quota-
ticuS, and so far not original3 yet his personal opinion does .
not disappear in this throng of sentences3 and, at all eventa,
the system is his own. He is not free from digressione}

. he cannot withstand the temptatiou of a tp the bpe, for

example in the chapters VI-X3 buthe notwithstanding sa-
fely leads his reader to the goal he had proposed: cou-
demuation of feuds aud wilful wars, and submissicn to law.
¹This is the principal tendeney of his book, and very re-
markable for the time when it was written3 but it has
another aim, not less remarkable though perhaps less ob-

vious. The superiority of Prudentia is not only due Ι .

to her representing Wisdom itself: Albuertano has certainly
’ meant to glorify in her person Woman in general. Yet he
did not, of course, dream of such a thing as Woman's
Emancipation and has accordingly represented her as the
loving wife of Melibeus, submissive and obedient to her
husband, at least iu form, though by far his better in ’
