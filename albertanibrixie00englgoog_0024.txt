'rowed from the treatise 01 Albertano De Arnore et Dile-
ctione Dei ¹. Jean de Mcung has generally abridged, now
and then in an nusparing manner3 but as he has upon the
wlicle followed his original, this will, even by'a direct
comparison, be 01 no little use to those who study the
Talaos Melite. As for the literal translations, it is so
evident that the Latin text offers an excellent means of
explaining, controlling and correcting thern, that Ι need not
enter into any demonstration of it; so much the more, as

such a collation, when possible, ought not to be neglected,
and that accordingly editors cf old texts should, for-that
purpose, always do their best to find out the latin origi-
nals from which they have sc often been derived.

Also in another respect does the Liber Consolationis
et Consilii prove important for the study 01 the middle·
ages. It is a curicus fact that mediaeval moralists, as
Gautier de Lille in his Moralium Dopmn, frequently corn-
posed their manuale almost exclusively from sayings of the
ancients⁹. Albertano has not done so; he very often
quotes the Bible and Christian writers; yet his treatise
contains a considerable number of passages borrowed from κ
ancient philosophers. ·Generally he names his author, but
often he does not, or, if he does, he substitutas oue name
for another. Even before the Chaucer Secia-ty, 1000-
tober 1811, gave the impulse to this edition, Ihad begun io

since spent a great deal 01 time end labour in these researches,
which may indeed sometimes offer an interest similar to
that 01 a hunter traching his game, but are upon the-
whcle far from amusing. Yet I believe this is the only
